# ✅ DONE - Athena CMS

## Link & Media Editor Robustness (v7.9.2) - 2026-02-09
- [x] **Universal Field Typing (data-dock-type)**
    - Added mandatory `data-dock-type` attributes (`text`, `media`, `link`) to all editable components (`EditableText`, `EditableMedia`, `EditableLink`).
    - This ensures the Athena Dock always opens the correct editor modal (e.g., Link Editor for links, Media for images) regardless of field naming.
    - Propagated these changes to all existing sites in `sites/` and shared templates.
- [x] **Shift+Click Interaction Mandate**
    - Standardized `Shift+Click` behavior across all sites to allow functional testing of links and buttons without triggering the editor.
    - Updated `dock-connector.js` across the entire ecosystem to support this logic.
- [x] **Object-Based Link Data (v7.8.7 Refinement)**
    - Updated `EditableLink` to support object-based values (containing both `label` and `url`).
    - Refactored `vite-plugin-athena-editor.js` to save the full link object to main data files, ensuring the frontend always has access to both label and destination.
    - Fixed corrupted `showcase.json` data in `athena-hub` where URLs were being overwritten by labels.
- [x] **Showcase & Process Section Polish**
    - Debugged and production-readied the `showcase` and `proces` sections in the `athena-showcase` sitetype.
    - Verified link functionality and visual consistency in the Athena Hub.

## Engine & Template Stability (v7.9.1)
- [x] **Vite Port Configuration Fix**
    - Corrected broken syntax in `factory/2-templates/config/vite.config.js` template (fixed missing braces and invalid formatting in port placeholder).
    - Upgraded `factory/5-engine/factory.js` with a robust regex-based replacement engine for `{{PORT}}` and `{{BASE_PATH}}` that handles optional spaces.
    - Manually repaired broken `vite.config.js` files for `demo-consultant` and `demo-bakkerij`.
    - Verified that `demo-consultant` now starts correctly on port 5982.
- [x] **Subfolder Preview Support (MIME Type Fix)**
    - Updated `vite.config.js` template to dynamically set the `base` path during development (e.g., `/demo-consultant/`).
    - This resolves "unsupported MIME type ('text/html')" errors for Service Workers (`sw.js`) and manifests when sites are accessed via a subfolder.
- [x] **Robust Data Loading Migration**
    - Converted brittle static imports in `demo-bakkerij` and `chocolade-shop` back to the robust `import.meta.glob` pattern.
    - Added `style_config.json` and `section_settings.json` to the mandatory file generation list in `factory.js`.
    - Automated creation of missing mandatory JSON files across all sites to prevent build failures.
- [x] **CSS Import Path Fix (demo-bakkerij)**
    - Fixed a 500 error caused by an incorrect `@import` path in `index.css`. The path was updated from `./modern.css` to `./css/modern.css` to match the project structure.
- [x] **Public Asset Transformation**
    - Enhanced `factory.js` to automatically replace placeholders (like `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`) in `public/manifest.json` and `public/sw.js` during site generation.
    - Manually fixed placeholders in existing showcase sites.

## UI/UX & Sitetype Management (v7.9.0)
- [x] **Sitetype Sync (athena-showcase)**
    - Updated `athena-showcase` sitetype with generalized `App.jsx` and `Header.jsx` from `athena-hub`.
    - Integrated dynamic `content_top_offset` and header transparency logic.
    - Standardized `Section.jsx` layout for high-end showcases.
- [x] **Dashboard Sitetype Refactor**
    - Converted Sitetypes tab into a detailed overview grid.
    - Moved SiteType Wizard creation flow to a modular modal.
    - Improved API to scan and display sitetypes from both `docked` and `autonomous` tracks.
- [x] **Site Re-generation (demo-consultant)**
    - Successfully rebuilt `demo-consultant` using the updated `athena-showcase` blueprint.
    - Verified data preservation and layout improvements.

## UI/UX & Data Sync (v7.8.9)
- [x] **Consolidated Sync Interface (Push/Pull)**
    - Replaced redundant "Visuals" and "Full Sync" buttons with a single **Push Sync** button.
    - Added **Pull Sync** button for fetching data from Google Sheets to local JSON.
    - Renamed and streamlined the Google Sheet Manager modal layout.
- [x] **Robust Pathing & Suffix Support**
    - Updated all sync engines (`sync-json-to-tsv.js`, `sync-json-to-sheet.js`, `sync-full-project-to-sheet.js`, `sync-sheet-to-json.js`) to support both `[id]` and `[id]-site` directory naming conventions.
    - Fixed path resolution issues in `dashboard/server.js` for project settings and data directories.
- [x] **Authentication & Provisioning Robustness**
    - Implemented Service Account fallback in `auto-sheet-provisioner.js` to bypass OAuth `invalid_grant` errors.
    - Added "Manual Actions" checklist to the Sheet Manager modal for public TSV publishing.
- [x] **Media Audit Utility**
    - Created `6-utilities/audit-media.js` to safely identify unused images and broken links.
- [x] **Chocolade Shop Restoration**
    - Fixed empty site issue by correctly importing and merging `style_config.json` in `main.jsx` and `App.jsx`.
    - Relinked to a fresh, correctly structured Google Sheet.

## UI/UX & Layout Controls (v7.8.8)
- [x] **Global Content Offset (Overlap Fix)**
    - Implemented `content_top_offset` as a global layout setting.
    - Added slider in Dock -> Design Editor.
    - Integrated CSS variable `--content-top-offset` into `App.jsx` and `dock-connector.js`.
- [x] **Advanced Header Controls in Dock**
    - Added live preview controls for:
        - `header_visible`: Toggle whole header.
        - `header_transparent`: Toggle background transparency/blur.
        - `header_height`: Adjustable height via slider.
        - `header_show_logo/title/tagline/button`: Toggle individual elements.
    - Updated `Header.jsx` boilerplate to support these dynamic variables.
- [x] **Dock Engine Refactor**
    - Updated `DesignControls.jsx` `handlePreview` to support non-prefixed variables for live preview.
    - Patched `athena-hub` as a reference implementation.

## UI/UX & Layout Controls (v7.8.7)
- [x] **Initial Hero & Header Controls** (Replaced by v7.8.8 refinement)

## Task Management & SOP
- [x] **Task Management Mandate**
    - Updated `factory/GEMINI.md` to require task management updates before starting tasks.
