### Added
- **Athena Data Hub**: Transformed the legacy "Projects" view into a centralized, 4-stage visual pipeline (Ingestion -> Extraction -> Core -> Cloud).
- **Data Gateway Modal**: Replaced the legacy "Sync" button with a unified gateway offering "Pull from Cloud", "Push to Cloud", and "Pull from local input folder".
- **Smart Preview Orchestration**: The `SiteController` now automatically checks if a site's dev server is running, installs dependencies if missing, and spawns the process via `ProcessManager`.
- **Client Onboarding Track**: Added a dedicated interactive roadmap for technical and commercial client onboarding via the Discovery Agent.
- **Unified Terminologie**: Standardized the use of "Data Bron" (Data Source) for all input folders across the dashboard, code, and documentation to eliminate confusion with generated sites.

### Changed
- **AI Data Extractor (Parser)**: Rebranded the AI Content Parser to "AI Data Extractor" with explicit technical documentation on data source and destination paths.
- **Unified Launcher**: Corrected root path calculation in `athena.js` and `athena-agent.js` to ensure reliable site discovery.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Updated all developer and client manuals to reflect the new "Data Source" terminology and Gateway workflow.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard API Consistency**: Added missing `/api/roadmaps` and `/api/todo` endpoints to ensure live roadmap tracking.

- **Interactive Roadmaps v2**: Expanded the roadmap system with Expert tracks for E-commerce and detailed accordion-based guidance.
- **Infrastructure Documentation**: Formally documented the account governance strategy (`karel.test.special@gmail.com` as primary development engine due to Google One AI quotas).

### Fixed
- **System Path Alignment**: Unified `ROOT_DIR` and `ATHENA_ROOT` variables in `.env` to prevent absolute path resolution errors.
- **Manual Site Synchronization**: Upgraded `Checkout.jsx` in existing sites (`chocolade-shop`, `urban-soles`, `demo-bakkerij`, `athena-pro`) to support the new payment flow.

## [7.9.3] - 2026-02-15
### Added
- **Gmail IMAP Integration**: Successfully transitioned the Athena Gateway to a dedicated Gmail account (`athena.cms.agent@gmail.com`).

- **Shift+Click Testing Support**: Standardized `Shift+Click` logic in `dock-connector.js` across all sites, allowing users to test links and functionality in the visual editor.

### Fixed
- **Object-Based Link Logic**: Updated `EditableLink` and `vite-plugin-athena-editor.js` to handle and persist full link objects (label + url) instead of splitting them. This prevents URLs from being overwritten by labels.

### Added
- **Dynamic Dev Base Path**: Vite configuration now automatically detects and sets the correct `base` path (e.g., `/project-name/`) during development. This ensures perfect compatibility with the dashboard's subfolder preview and fixes Service Worker registration errors.
- **Smart Public Asset Transformation**: The factory engine now recursively scans and transforms placeholders in `public/` assets (like `manifest.json` and `sw.js`) during site generation.
- **Mandatory Data Guard**: Expanded `factory.js` to automatically generate `style_config.json`, `layout_settings.json`, and `section_settings.json` to prevent import errors in the main entry point.

### Fixed
- **Vite Port Placeholder**: Resolved a critical syntax error in the `vite.config.js` template where the `{{PORT}}` placeholder was malformed and missing closing braces.
